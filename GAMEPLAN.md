The first thing i did was check out some of the SVGs that are included in the project files and see what i am working with. I did some research and am planning on creating divs with the same background color as the svgs and line them up to create the smooth looking effect that the mock-ups are going for.

I broke the mockups down into the components that i am going to create.

## Components

- Header
- Hero
- section 1 (DATA)
- section 2 (SALES INFO 1)
- section 3 (SALES INFO 2)
- section 4 (SALES INFO 3)
- section 5 (CALL TO ACTION)
- Footer

I will build the Header Hero and Footer first to get the base page layout done then build and insert the 5 components as needed. We will have shared classes for the flex rows in section 1, 2, 3 and 4. Section 5 and the hero section will both be flex-columns.
